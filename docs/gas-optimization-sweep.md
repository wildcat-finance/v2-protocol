# V2.5 Gas Optimization Sweep

Status: experimental branch work. Nothing in this document is deployment approval.

Largest release artifacts at baseline:

| Contract                 | Initcode bytes | Runtime bytes | EIP-170 margin |
| ------------------------ | -------------: | ------------: | -------------: |
| `WildcatMarketRevolving` |         23,175 |        21,664 |          2,912 |
| `WildcatMarket`          |         22,557 |        21,133 |          3,443 |
| `MarketLensAggregator`   |         20,788 |        20,520 |          4,056 |
| `MarketLensCore`         |         19,896 |        19,726 |          4,850 |
| `PeriodicTermHooks`      |         22,332 |        19,502 |          5,074 |

The earlier optimizer sweep already tested every run count from 1 through 200, plus 50,000
and the maximum `uint32`. This sweep keeps the selected 44-run release profile and focuses on
source and architecture instead of repeating compiler folklore.

## Measurement Contract

Every accepted candidate must be measured against the exact baseline or the immediately prior
accepted commit. The comparison includes:

- fixed-seed Forge gas snapshots and focused gas reports;
- initcode and runtime byte counts for the optimized release artifacts;
- exact ABI hashes;
- normalized storage-layout hashes; and
- focused tests first, followed by the full suite before handoff.

Generate the manifest with:

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=deploy forge build --skip test --skip script --extra-output storageLayout
node scripts/gas-sweep-metrics.js \
  --artifacts deploy-out \
  --snapshot /tmp/wildcat-v25-gas-baseline.snap
```

The raw baseline files stay outside the repository under `/tmp`; this report records their
reproducible inputs and hashes instead of committing a 160 KiB snapshot.

## Tooling Notes

The documented `docs/coverage-spherex.patch` clears Forge and Slither's named-return-value issue
in `SphereXProtectedRegisteredBase`. Repository-wide Slither then stops on a separate unsupported
pattern: the overloaded dynamic library-function casts used by the market constructor. Targeted
Slither passes work and are used as leads, but the release artifact, tests, and source review are
the actual evidence.

Rejected candidates and benchmark results will be added here as the sweep progresses.
